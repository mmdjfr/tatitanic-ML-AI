# Titanic-ML-AI
### This is a machine learning project that can predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

You have access to datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.

Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.

#### I have done this project by using:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sickit Learn

wish to be useful for you!
